# Notes


 - All weights are in terms of peeled/prepared/cut fruits.
 - Banana peel is ~1/3 to 2/5 of the banana weight
 - All ingredients are frozen when put in the blender, with the obvious exception of orange juice (OJ) and milk
 - A quality blender matters a lot: in terms of taste, it improves it, and drastically improves it when freezing the blend and eating it later (a rough blend will feels a bit like crushed ice with a fruity taste, whereas the finer blend will give you the fully fruity taste). It also can save you a lot of the time you'd spend to blend the frozen ingredients; from 20 minutes, it now takes me 3-4 mins at worst.

## Fresh vs frozen ingredients

There is a noticeable difference in taste, and starting with frozen ingredients (with the exception of milk) is far better. I usually take them out for 20-25 mins before eating, because it's hard as a rock.

With fresh ingredients, you'll have small bubbles, and they will freeze. When eating it, it feels crunchy and the taste is OK.

With frozen ingredients, you won't have bubbles, and when you'll eat, it will be a smooth paste (not in a bad way at all) like ice cream, and the taste is just so much better. While it's somewhat difficult to tell what fruit was used when starting with fresh, it's very easy with frozen ingredients.

## Fruits to avoid

- Honeydew Melon: just doesn't taste great
- Kiwi: tastes awful (at least the pre-frozen ones)
- Pears: a bit more chunky than other fruits, and not that great in terms of taste
- Apples: likely similar to pears

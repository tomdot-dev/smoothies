# Notes


 - All weights are in terms of peeled/prepared/cut fruits.
 - Banana peel is ~1/3 to 2/5 of the banana weight
 - All ingredients are frozen when put in the blender, with the obvious exception of orange juice (OJ) and milk
 - A quality blender matters a lot: in terms of taste, it improves it, and drastically improves it when freezing the blend and eating it later (a rough blend will feels a bit like crushed ice with a fruity taste, whereas the finer blend will give you the fully fruity taste). It also can save you a lot of the time you'd spend to blend the frozen ingredients; from 20 minutes, it now takes me 3-4 mins at worst.

## Fruits to avoid

- Honeydew Melon: just doesn't taste great
- Kiwi: tastes awful (at least the pre-frozen ones)
- Pears: a bit more chunky than other fruits, and not that great in terms of taste
- Apples: likely similar to pears

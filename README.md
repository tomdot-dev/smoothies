# Smoothies recipes

It will yield about 3 cups of smoothie (or ~720ml).

## Strawberry (the classic)

- 250g banana
- 75g strawberry
- 5-6oz milk

## Blueberry

- 250g banana
- 75-80g blackberries
- 4-5oz milk

## Blackberry

- 250g banana
- 75-80g blackberries
- 4-5oz milk

## Açaí strawberry

- 1 banana portion
- 100g açaí (or açaí puree)
- 4.5 oz OJ
- 50-60g strawberries

Notes:
- Avoid just using açaí (with banana), or milk as açaí seem to somewhat kill the taste (but not the texture)
- Just açaí with banana plus milk is great when frozen, it has a slight chocolaty taste

## Raspberry

- 250g banana
- 75-80g raspberry
- 1-2 chunk mango
- 5 oz milk

For intense taste: 160g raspberries and no mango

## Peach

- 250g banana
- 75-80g peaches chunks
- 4-5oz milk

## Watermelon

- 250g banana
- 150g watermelon
- 5-6oz milk
- Touch of honey (about a teaspon)

Notes:
- By far, the best smoothie in terms of taste (immediately, and after freezing), beats the classic banana, strawberry, and milk.
- Using more than 3/5 proportion for watermelon (compared to bananas) will make it start to taste watered down. 

## Pineapple

Base recipe:
- 250g banana
- 150g pineapple (and if there is any in the container, its juice)
- 4-6oz milk

To intensify the taste of pineapple, replace milk by orange juice

Adding 50g of one of the following fruits adds a light touch of them:
- strawberry
- mango (3-4 chunks of 1cm cubes)
- raspberry
- blueberry

### Pineapple Mango

Using the base recipe without any additional fruit, add:
- 100g mango
- 6oz milk

Notes:
- It differs with the above one as the taste of pineapple is much more mellow/subdued, but nonetheless present
- Amazingly delicious (immediately and frozen), by a lot, and second place in terms of taste after the watermelon one

### Pineapple Blueberry

Using the base recipe without any additional fruit, add:
- 150g mango
- 6oz milk

Note: Pineapple taste is still present; you'd probably need 200-250g of them to mellow the pineapple taste as much as the mango

### Pineapple, Carrot, Mango, and Passion fruit

Using the base recipe without any additional fruit, add:
- 60g carrots
- 40g pineapple
- 30g mango
- 20g passionfruit
- 6oz milk

Notes:
- Carrots/pineapple/mango/passion fruit came from a prepackaged frozen mix
- Even though the quantity of carrots is high in comparison of other fruits, the taste is actually quite faint
- Surprisingly, it tastes good

## Forest fruits

- 250g banana
- 75g forest fruit mix (strawberry, blackberry, and raspberry)
  - 30g strawberry
  - 30g blackberry
  - 15g raspberry
- 4 mango chunks
- 3 oz milk

## Papaya

- 250g banana
- 150g papaya
- Optionally, 40g strawberry
- 4-5oz milk

Note: papaya doesn't have a strong taste, so double papaya and strawberry amounts for intense

## Cantaloupe

- 250g banana
- 200g cantaloupe
- 5oz milk

## Cherry

- 250g banana
- 200g cherries
- 4oz milk

Note: Banana taste still a bit present (at least right after blending, but definitely not after freezing) and may want to add more cherries.

## Guava

- 250g banana
- 200g guava pulp
- 5oz milk

## Passion fruit

- 250g banana
- 200g passion fruit pulp
- 5oz milk

Note: It is fairly sour/acidic, and maybe adding mangoes helps bring sour/acidic taste down

# Smoothies recipes

## Notes

- All weights are in terms of peeled/prepared/cut fruits.
- Banana peel is ~1/3 of the banana weight
- All ingredients are frozen when put in the blender, with the obvious exception of orange juice (OJ) and milk
- A quality blender matters a lot: in terms of taste, it improves it, and drastically improves it when freezing the blend and eating it later (a rough blend will feels a bit like crushed ice with a fruity taste, whereas the finer blend will give you the fully fruity taste). It also can save you a lot of the time you'd spend to blend the frozen ingredients; from 20 minutes, it now takes me 3-4 mins at worst.

### Fruits to avoid

- Melon: just doesn't taste great
- Kiwi: tastes awful (at least the pre-frozen ones)
- Pears: a bit more chunky than other fruits, and not that great in terms of taste
- Apples: likely similar to pears

### Tips

- From a taste perspective, the fat amount in milk doesn't seem to matter much
- Selection on blender: Spoonable -> Bowl => Best taste when freezing the result
- Add a touch of honey to make it even more amazing when freezing the blend and eating it later.
- Avoid yogurt (only tried yogurt without added sugar) as it is acid and kills the taste of fruits, even more when freezing the blend
- When using frozen ingredients, know that prepackaged fruits are cheaper than fresh ones, and has little difference in terms of taste (maybe the exception is kiwi - NEEDS testing)
- Avoid prepackaged bananas (or mix with it), as it doesn't seem to last as long as other fruits in the freezer, and it also spoils much quicker (and taste is bad)
- When freezing the blend, ideally, make a 1/2 inch (or ~1cm tall layer) in containers. When taking it out of the freezer, let it sit 15-20 minutes before eating. If using popsicles-type containers, put room temperature water in a cup and put the popsicle underneath in it. Wait 30 second, then wiggle the stick, and it should come out. You can (and should) eat it immediately.

## Recipes

It will yield about 3 cups of smoothie.

### Açaí strawberry

- 1 banana portion
- 100g açaí (or açaí puree)
- 4.5 oz OJ
- 50-60g strawberries

Notes:
- Avoid just using acai (with banana), or milk as acai seem to somewhat kill the taste (but not the texture)
- Just acai with banana plus milk is great when frozen, slight chocolaty taste

Note: By far, the best smoothie in terms of taste (immediately, and after freezing), beats the classic banana, strawberry, and milk.
